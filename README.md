# frdmn's Homebrew formulas

This a [brew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) [tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme) repository containing a collection of "formulae" for most of my daily use projects.

## Usage

First, add this tap to your Brew. This will to clone Pivotal tap repository and symlink all its formulae.

    brew tap frdmn/formulas

Now you will be able to work on those formulae as if there were in canonical Homebrew repository:
